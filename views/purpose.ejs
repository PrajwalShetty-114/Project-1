        <h1>Project Purpose</h1>
        <p>This is my small backend project built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. It helped me understand routing,
            middleware, and server-side rendering. I implemented a contact form with email functionality using
            Nodemailer, which I explored through AI guidance. The project includes clean routing, static file
            management, and a simple, responsive UI.

            I used GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT for UI/UX suggestions. This project gave me hands-on
            backend experience and is a strong start to my full-stack journey.
